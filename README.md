# whatsapp-clone
WhatsApp clone - focused on pixel perfect design and making the app aesthetic. support both desktop and mobile scenarios.
The app design is based on my pesonal devices (ASUS ZenBook windows 11 and PocoPhone F1 xiomi)
and may not be similer to other devices and operating system. 
##this app is design only and at the moment dont support sevral users and saving data to a database.


## Tech/framework used for client
##### Built with
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) as client framework
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) for creating a more readable, efficient, clean code for the style 
* [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/v2.28.0/docs/format) a library for formating dates into strings and calculating the distance between dates.  
 
 ## Installation
clone this repo, go to its root directory and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm start` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000



## Room for Improvement
There's a lot more that needs to be done...
#### TODO
* make the popup menu's close when the user clicks on something else
* Add dark mode to the app 
* add a side menu for more info about the users and chats 
* handling errors and informing the user about them 
* built a server and save the messages the a database
