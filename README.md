# WhatsApp-clone
WhatsApp clone - focused on pixel-perfect design and making the app aesthetic and responsive.
The app design is based on my personal devices (laptop:ASUS ZenBook windows 11 and phone: PocoPhone F1 Xiaomi)
and may not be similar to other devices and operating systems, like ios. 
###### This is a design demo and doesnt function as a chat application yet, but in the future I may add a server. 

## Demo
check out my demo [here](https://optimistic-heisenberg-7871bb.netlify.app/)

## Tech/framework used for client
##### Built with
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) as client framework
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) for creating a more readable, efficient, clean code for the style 
* [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/v2.28.0/docs/format) a library for formating dates into strings and calculating the distance between dates.  
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage and access my state from every component
 
 ## Installation
clone this repo, go to its root directory, and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm start` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000



## Room for Improvement
There's a lot more that needs to be done...
#### TODO
* make the popup menu close when the user clicks on something else
* Add dark mode to the app 
* add a side menu for more info about the users and chats 
* handling errors and informing the user about them 
* built a server and save the messages to the database

and so much more...
